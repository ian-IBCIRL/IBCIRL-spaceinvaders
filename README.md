Claude-4-sonnet aka Amazon Q, your AI assistant built by AWS, promises to help me with AWS services, infrastructure, coding,
system administration, and more. I asked it to help simple Space Invaders game built using JavaScript and HTML

It said it would help me create a simple Space Invaders game using JavaScript and HTML. 
It attempted to build a complete, playable version of Space Invaders game for you! 

And we just added a React Mobile version at space-invaders-mobile.html


## Features
Here's what I've built:

Features:
• Player spaceship that moves left/right with arrow keys
• Shooting with spacebar
• 50 invaders in a 5x10 grid that move side to side and down
• Invaders shoot back at random intervals
• Collision detection for bullets hitting invaders and player
• Score system (10 points per invader)
• Game over screen with restart functionality
• Progressive difficulty (invaders speed up each wave)

Controls:
• Arrow keys: Move left/right
• Spacebar: Shoot
• R key: Restart when game over

Game Mechanics:
• Invaders move horizontally and drop down when they hit screen edges
• Game ends if invaders reach the player or if player gets hit by invader bullets
• New wave of invaders appears when all are destroyed
• Score increases by 10 for each invader destroyed

To play the game, simply open the space-invaders.html file in your web browser:

- Player movement using arrow keys
- Laser firing with the spacebar
- Target space invaders that explode when hit by a laser
- Score tracking for each invader hit
